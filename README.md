# Drum Kit Project

The Drum Kit project is an interactive web application that allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing keyboard keys or clicking on drum buttons. Each drum sound is associated with a specific key or button, and when triggered, the corresponding sound is played along with a visual animation.

## Usage

To use the Drum Kit:

1. Open the web application in a web browser.
2. Press the corresponding keys on your keyboard for each drum sound, or click on the drum buttons using your mouse.
3. Enjoy playing different drum sounds and seeing the visual animation for each sound.

## Features

- **Keyboard Press Detection:** The application detects keyboard key presses and maps them to specific drum sounds.
- **Click Press Detection:** The drum buttons on the web page respond to click events, allowing users to play sounds by clicking on the buttons.
- **Sound Playback:** When a valid key or button is pressed, the application plays the corresponding drum sound.
- **Visual Animation:** Each drum button displays a temporary animation when pressed, providing a visual feedback to the user.

## Customization

You can customize the Drum Kit project by making the following changes:

- **Sound Mapping:** Modify the `soundMap` object in the JavaScript code to map different keys or buttons to your desired drum sounds. Make sure to have corresponding sound files in the `sounds/` directory.
- **HTML Structure and Styling:** Customize the HTML structure and CSS styling to match your project's design preferences.

## Credits
